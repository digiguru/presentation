			Welcome everyone to the presentation! Today, we will be discussing Adam Hall's journey from a former Agile Coach to an amateur artist and a talkative technophile. Be prepared for an exciting story!
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			As we dive deeper into Adam's journey, we come across a pivotal moment when OpenAI announced its revolutionary language model, GPT-3. This event sparked widespread interest and engagement across various social media platforms.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			GPT-3 caught the attention of not only tech enthusiasts but also influential media outlets like Bloomberg News, further amplifying its impact.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			OpenAI then proceeded to invite people to try out GPT-3, providing an opportunity for users to experience the power of this groundbreaking AI technology.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			As people started experimenting with GPT-3, they found it could be used in various creative ways, such as generating rap lyrics or even mimicking the Joker's response to a question about Twitter management.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			GPT-3's versatility also extended to more practical applications, like writing user stories for product teams in an engaging and efficient manner.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			The AI's potential to generate content, like intros to blog posts about sprint planning, became increasingly evident as users continued to explore its capabilities.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			When given specific instructions, GPT-3 could even tailor its output to match the desired tone or style, such as writing a blog post intro in the voice of an angry gangster.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			GPT-3's ability to adapt to various styles and tones made it especially useful for prioritizing tasks on a to-do list while maintaining an entertaining and engaging persona.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			However, GPT-3 was not without its flaws. Bias could still be an issue, as demonstrated by the character bios generated for a careworker and a Director of Technology.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			GPT-3's potential for spreading misinformation also became a growing concern as users continued to experiment with its capabilities.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			Despite these concerns, GPT-3's ability to write code and integrate with other applications, like a Jira app, showcased its immense potential for transforming various industries.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			GPT-3 could even be used to give AI a distinct personality, such as mimicking the voice of the Joker, further demonstrating its versatility and adaptability.
			</aside>
			<aside class="notes">
			As we look towards the future and the development of GPT-4, we can expect significant improvements in content understanding, output length, and even image recognition capabilities.
