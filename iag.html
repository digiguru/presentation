						<aside class="notes">
							On June 11, 2020, an AI research and deployment company OpenAI – founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others – announced its revolutionary language model, GPT-3. The news quickly created buzz in tech circles with demo videos of early GPT-3 prototypes going viral on Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News.

							<p>Milestones! Yes. Although no.</p>
							<p>A milestone is used to indicate a distance from a paticular town</p>								
							<p>It is a way of trying to determine how much distance is left</p>
							<p>Sprints are milestones. You know the frequency and you can look to see how quickly you are travelling towards the destination.</p>
							<p>But when we say "Release" it now changes the nature - we are applying a state change on top of a measure of distance.</p>
							<p>In Gantt charts milestones are rarly just moments in time - usually moments when you enter a meeting with a stakeholder to apologise for the late delivery, promising that the next quarter will, for some reason, be better (because all the hard stuff is done, apparently).</p>

						<img src="assets/deadline.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>I also heard someone mention Deadlines.</p>
							<p>What is a deadline? The term itself is thought by some to come from the US Civil War</p>
							<p>It refers to a visual boundary around a prison. If a prisoner crossed it, they would be shot on site. We put these in our projects to indicate the same idea</p>
							<p>whether the punishment for crossing your deadline is the same as that in the Civil War will largely depend on where you work.</p>
							<p>And yet it's rarely such a clean death. Instead the project sponsor withdraws funding and asks for frequent updates, slowly starving the team of its resources until it either limps over the delivery line or dies trying at a much later date than anticipated.</p>
							<p>In a world where deadlines cease to be a concern, is there much point in imposing artifical deadlines on a project?</p>

							<p>It's the same with stakeholders.</p>							
							<p>This example shows a burnup of time. It uses a python tool called Jira Agile Metrics</p>
							<p>They "KNEW" that the project was going to be released on 31st July.</p>
							<p>I joined and could tell them with confidence that this wasn't the case, and projected the 15th Septemeber.</p>								
							<p>It turns out we were both wrong. It was actually the 14th September.</p>								
							<p>This tool is external to Jira but requires a bit of integration</p>
							<p>It uses Monte Carlo estimation - essentially an algorythem to simulate past behavior to forecats future outcomes.</p>
							<p>Whilst Jira has burnups built in - it relies on you sturcturing your data with the "Release versions" - and any past data is not really included in the insights report. </p>
